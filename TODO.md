# Bangladesh Education Data Warehouse - Project Status & TODO

*Last Updated: 2025-06-22*

## 🏛️ Architecture Review

### Current Architecture Assessment

#### Violations of Clean Architecture Principles
1. **Layer Violations**
   - 🟡 The `auth` service has been partially refactored to use interfaces, but still has some direct dependencies on database models
   - ✅ API endpoints are now properly separated with DTOs in `interfaces/api/v1/schemas/`
   - ✅ Configuration has been moved to `config/` directory with proper environment variable handling

2. **Dependency Direction**
   - 🟡 Domain models are mostly clean but some ORM relationships still exist in `src/core/entities/`
   - ✅ Business logic is now better separated with services in `src/application/services/`

3. **Separation of Concerns**
   - ✅ `AuthService` has been split into smaller, focused services (`AuthService`, `TokenService`, `UserService`)
   - ✅ Clear distinction between domain and application services established

4. **Testing**
   - 🟡 Unit tests exist but coverage is incomplete (mostly in `tests/unit/`)
   - ✅ Interfaces for external services have been defined in `src/core/ports/`

### Implementation Status

#### 1. Folder Structure (✅ Implemented)
```
src/
├── core/                    # Core domain models and business rules
│   ├── entities/            # Domain entities
│   ├── value_objects/      
│   ├── repositories/       
│   └── services/          
├── application/           
│   ├── services/          
│   └── ports/            
├── infrastructure/        
│   ├── persistence/      
│   ├── auth/            
│   └── config/          
└── interfaces/           
    └── api/             
```

#### 2. Key Refactoring Tasks
- [✅] Create proper domain models without ORM dependencies (`src/core/entities/`)
- [✅] Define repository interfaces (`src/core/ports/`)
- [🟡] Move business logic from services to domain models (partial)
- [✅] Implement DTOs (`src/interfaces/api/v1/schemas/`)
- [✅] Add dependency injection (using `dependency_injector`)
- [✅] Create interfaces for external services (`src/core/ports/`)
- [✅] Move configuration to infrastructure layer (`src/infrastructure/config/`)

#### 3. Dependency Management
- [ ] Ensure all dependencies point inwards (domain ← application ← infrastructure)
- [ ] Use dependency injection to manage dependencies
- [ ] Create proper interfaces for all external services

#### 4. Testing Strategy
- [ ] Implement unit tests for domain models
- [ ] Add integration tests for use cases
- [ ] Add contract tests for external services
- [ ] Implement end-to-end tests for API endpoints

#### 5. Documentation
- [ ] Document the architecture decisions
- [ ] Add architecture diagrams
- [ ] Document module responsibilities and boundaries

### Immediate Actions
1. Start by extracting domain models from ORM models
2. Define clear interfaces for repositories and services
3. Refactor the authentication service to follow single responsibility principle
4. Implement proper error handling and validation at appropriate layers
