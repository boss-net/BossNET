# Security Guidelines and Configuration

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures and configurations implemented in the Bangladesh Student Data Analytics project to protect sensitive educational data.

## Data Classification

### Sensitive Data
- Student personal information
- Academic records
- Family information
- Contact details
- Financial information

### Public Data
- Aggregated statistics
- Anonymous research data
- General performance metrics
- Institution-level data

## Security Measures

### 1. Data Encryption
- All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- Transport layer security (TLS) for data in transit
- Key rotation policies
- Secure key management

### 2. Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews
- Multi-factor authentication

### 3. Data Privacy
- Data anonymization
- Privacy-preserving aggregation
- Consent management
- Data retention policies

### 4. Audit Logging
- Comprehensive activity logging
- Security event monitoring
- Regular log reviews
- Retention of audit trails

## Security Configurations

### Access Levels
```python
ACCESS_LEVELS = {
    'ADMIN': 100,
    'ANALYST': 75,
    'RESEARCHER': 50,
    'VIEWER': 25
}
```

### Sensitive Fields
```python
SENSITIVE_FIELDS = [
    'student_id',
    'name',
    'date_of_birth',
    'address',
    'guardian_info',
    'contact_number'
]
```

### Data Retention Periods
```python
RETENTION_PERIODS = {
    'raw_data': 365,       # 1 year
    'processed_data': 730,  # 2 years
    'audit_logs': 1825,    # 5 years
    'user_activity': 180   # 6 months
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Data Access
- Always use encryption for sensitive data
- Implement access controls at all layers
- Regular security audits
- Monitor and log all access

### 2. Authentication
- Strong password policies
- Multi-factor authentication
- Session management
- Regular credential rotation

### 3. Authorization
- Role-based access control
- Feature-level permissions
- Regular permission reviews
- Audit of access patterns

### 4. Data Protection
- Encryption at rest
- Secure transmission
- Regular backups
- Secure disposal

## Security Headers

All API responses include:
```http
