## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Authentication
- Uses asymmetric encryption (RS256) for JWT tokens
- Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes by default)
- Refresh token mechanism for obtaining new access tokens
- Token revocation support

### Password Security
- BCrypt hashing with work factor of 12
- Password complexity requirements
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Password reset flow with time-limited tokens

## Input Validation

### Request Validation
- Pydantic models for all request/response schemas
- Strict type checking
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS and injection attacks
- File upload validation (type, size, content)

### Security Headers

All responses include the following security headers:

- `Content-Security-Policy`: Restricts resource loading
- `Strict-Transport-Security`: Enforces HTTPS
- `X-Content-Type-Options`: Prevents MIME sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options`: Prevents clickjacking
- `X-XSS-Protection`: Enables XSS filtering
- `Referrer-Policy`: Controls referrer information
- `Permissions-Policy`: Controls browser features

## Rate Limiting

- Global rate limiting (100 requests/minute by default)
- Per-user rate limiting
- Configurable rate limits via environment variables
- Redis-backed rate limiting for distributed systems

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- Data at rest: Database encryption
- Data in transit: TLS 1.2+
- Sensitive fields encrypted in database

### Session Security
- Secure, HTTP-only cookies
- SameSite cookie policy
- Secure flag on cookies in production

## Dependency Management

- Regular security audits with `safety`
- Pinned dependency versions
- Automatic dependency updates with Dependabot
- Security updates applied within 24 hours of release

## Monitoring & Logging

### Security Logging
- All authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Permission changes
- Sensitive operations
- Rate limit hits

### Monitoring
- Suspicious activity alerts
- Failed login attempts
- Unusual traffic patterns

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for security utilities
- Integration tests for auth flows
- OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning

### Manual Testing
- Penetration testing
- Code reviews with security focus
- Threat modeling

## Incident Response

### Reporting Security Issues

Please report security issues to security@example.com. You should receive a response within 24 hours.

### Response Plan

1. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Eradication**: Remove the threat
3. **Recovery**: Restore services
4. **Post-mortem**: Document and learn

## Best Practices

### For Developers
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Validate all user input

### For Administrators
- Regular security audits
- Monitor security advisories
- Keep systems patched
- Regular backups

## Compliance

This application follows security best practices from:
- OWASP Top 10
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- GDPR requirements
- ISO 27001 standards
